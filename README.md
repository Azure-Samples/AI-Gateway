The rapid pace of AI advances demands experimentation-driven approaches for organizations to remain at the forefront of the industry. With AI steadily becoming a game-changer for an array of sectors, maintaining a fast-paced innovation trajectory is crucial for businesses aiming to leverage its full potential.

**AI services** are predominantly accessed via **APIs**, underscoring the essential need for a robust and efficient API management strategy. This strategy is instrumental for maintaining control and governance over the consumption of **AI services**.

With the expanding horizons of **AI services** and their seamless integration with **APIs**, there is a considerable demand for a comprehensive **AI Gateway** pattern, which broadens the core principles of API management. Aiming to accelerate the experimentation of advanced use cases and pave the road for further innovation in this rapidly evolving field. The well-architected principles of the **AI Gateway** provides a framework for the confident deployment of **Intelligent Apps** into production.

## 🧠 GenAI Gateway

![AI-Gateway flow](images/ai-gateway.gif)

This repo explores the **AI Gateway** pattern through a series of experimental labs. The [GenAI Gateway capabilities](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-integration-services-blog/introducing-genai-gateway-capabilities-in-azure-api-management/ba-p/4146525) of [Azure API Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts) plays a crucial role within these labs, handling AI services APIs, with security, reliability, performance, overall operational efficiency and cost controls. The primary focus is on [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview), which sets the standard reference for Large Language Models (LLM). However, the same principles and design patterns could potentially be applied to any LLM.

## 🧪 Labs

Acknowledging the rising dominance of Python, particularly in the realm of AI, along with the powerful experimental capabilities of Jupyter notebooks, the following labs are structured around Jupyter notebooks, with step-by-step instructions with Python scripts, [Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview?tabs=bicep) files and [Azure API Management policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-policies):

## 🔨 Tools

* [AI-Gateway Mock server](tools/mock-server/mock-server.ipynb) is designed to mimic the behavior and responses of the OpenAI API, thereby creating an efficient simulation environment suitable for testing and development purposes on the integration with Azure API Management and other use cases. The [app.py](tools/mock-server/app.py) can be customized to tailor the Mock server to specific use cases.
* [Tracing](tools/tracing.ipynb) - Invoke OpenAI API with trace enabled and returns the tracing information.
* [Streaming](streaming.ipynb) - Invoke OpenAI API with stream enabled and returns response in chunks.
