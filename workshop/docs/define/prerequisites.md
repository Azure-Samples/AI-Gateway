# Prerequisites

To complete this workshop, you will need the following:

1. A GitHub account. Get a free GitHub account [here](https://github.com/)
1. An Azure account. Create a free Azure account [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)

    :::tip[Note]

    Your Azure account must either have [Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/privileged#contributor) + [Role Based Access Control Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/privileged#role-based-access-control-administrator) or Owner.

    If you have your own personal Azure subscription, you should be good to go. If you're using an Azure subscription provided by your company, you may need to contact your IT department to ensure you have the necessary permissions.

You have a few options for getting started with the labs. The quickest way to get started is [GitHub Codespaces](#github-codespaces), since it will setup all the tools for you in the cloud, but you can also [set it up locally](#local-environment). You can also use a [VS Code dev container](#vs-code-dev-containers)

## GitHub Codespaces
