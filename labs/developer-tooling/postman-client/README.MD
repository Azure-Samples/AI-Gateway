# APIM ❤️ OpenAI

## [Developer tooling lab](developer-tooling.ipynb)

Playground to try the developer tooling available with APIM to develop, debugg, test and publish AI Service APIs.

### Prerequisites

- [An Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) with Contributor permissions
- [Access granted to Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access) or just enable the mock service
- [Sign in to Azure with Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli-interactively)

### 🚀 Get started

### 🗑️ Clean up resources

When you're finished with the lab, you should remove all your deployed resources from Azure to avoid extra charges and keep your Azure subscription uncluttered.
Use the [clean-up-resources notebook](clean-up-resources.ipynb) for that.
