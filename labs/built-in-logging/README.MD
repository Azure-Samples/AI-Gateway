## [Built-in logging lab](built-in-logging.ipynb)

[![flow](../../images/built-in-logging.gif)](built-in-logging.ipynb)

Playground to try the [built-in LLM logging capabilities of API Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/monitor-api-management#modify-api-logging-settings). Consumed tokens, prompts and completions are logged automatically into Azure Monitor, and it's easy to explore the data with the provided [notebook](llm-logging-workbook.json).

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.12 or later version](https://www.python.org/) installed
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed with the [Jupyter notebook extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) enabled
- [Python environment](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_creating-environments) with the [requirements.txt](../../requirements.txt) or run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal
- [An Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with [Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/privileged#contributor) + [RBAC Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/privileged#role-based-access-control-administrator) or [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/privileged#owner) roles
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed and [Signed into your Azure subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli-interactively)

### üöÄ Get started

Proceed by opening the [Jupyter notebook](built-in-logging.ipynb), and follow the steps provided.

### üóëÔ∏è Clean up resources

When you're finished with the lab, you should remove all your deployed resources from Azure to avoid extra charges and keep your Azure subscription uncluttered.
Use the [clean-up-resources notebook](clean-up-resources.ipynb) for that.
