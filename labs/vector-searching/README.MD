# APIM ‚ù§Ô∏è OpenAI

## [Vector Searching lab](vector-searching.ipynb)

[![flow](../../images/vector-searching.gif)](vector-searching.ipynb)

Playground to try the [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview) with Azure AI Search, Azure OpenAI embeddings and Azure OpenAI completions. All the endpoints are managed via APIM.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Reuses the [AI Orchestration with Azure AI Search](https://github.com/Azure/intro-to-intelligent-apps/blob/main/labs/03-orchestration/04-ACS/acs-lc-python.ipynb) notebook from the [intro to intelligent Apps workshop](https://github.com/Azure/intro-to-intelligent-apps/).

### üöÄ Get started

Proceed by opening the [Jupyter notebook](vector-searching.ipynb), and follow the steps provided.

### üóëÔ∏è Clean up resources

When you're finished with the lab, you should remove all your deployed resources from Azure to avoid extra charges and keep your Azure subscription uncluttered.
Use the [clean-up-resources notebook](clean-up-resources.ipynb) for that.
