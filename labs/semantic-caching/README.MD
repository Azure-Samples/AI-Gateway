# APIM ‚ù§Ô∏è OpenAI

## [Semantic Caching lab](semantic-caching.ipynb)

[![flow](../../images/semantic-caching.gif)](semantic-caching.ipynb)

Playground to try the [sementic caching policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/azure-openai-semantic-cache-lookup-policy).

The azure-openai-semantic-cache-lookup policy conducts a cache lookup of responses on Azure OpenAI Chat Completion API and Completion API requests from a pre-configured external cache. It operates by comparing the vector proximity of the prompt to prior requests and using a specific similarity score threshold. Caching responses helps reduce bandwidth and processing demands on the backend Azure OpenAI API, thus reducing latency perceived by API consumers.

### üöÄ Get started

Proceed by opening the [Jupyter notebook](semantic-caching.ipynb), and follow the steps provided.

### üóëÔ∏è Clean up resources

When you're finished with the lab, you should remove all your deployed resources from Azure to avoid extra charges and keep your Azure subscription uncluttered.
Use the [clean-up-resources notebook](clean-up-resources.ipynb) for that.
