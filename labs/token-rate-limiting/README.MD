# APIM ‚ù§Ô∏è AI Foundry

## [Token Rate Limiting lab](token-rate-limiting.ipynb)

[![flow](../../images/token-rate-limiting.gif)](token-rate-limiting.ipynb)

Playground to try the [token rate limiting policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/azure-openai-token-limit-policy) to one or more Azure AI Foundry endpoints.

The azure-openai-token-limit policy prevents Azure OpenAI Service API usage spikes on a per key basis by limiting consumption of language model tokens to a specified number per minute. When the token usage is exceeded, the caller receives a 429 Too Many Requests response status code.

### üöÄ Get started

Proceed by opening the [Jupyter notebook](token-rate-limiting.ipynb), and follow the steps provided.

### üóëÔ∏è Clean up resources

When you're finished with the lab, you should remove all your deployed resources from Azure to avoid extra charges and keep your Azure subscription uncluttered.
Use the [clean-up-resources notebook](clean-up-resources.ipynb) for that.
