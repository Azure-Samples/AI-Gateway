# APIM ‚ù§Ô∏è OpenAI

## [Function calling lab](function-calling.ipynb)

[![flow](../../images/function-calling.gif)](function-callingg.ipynb)

Playground to try the OpenAI [function calling](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/function-calling?tabs=non-streaming%2Cpython) feature with an Azure Functions API also managed with APIM.

At a high level you can break down working with functions into three steps:

1. Call the chat completions API with your functions and the user‚Äôs input
2. Use the model‚Äôs response to call your API or function
3. Call the chat completions API again, including the response from your function to get a final response

### üöÄ Get started

Proceed by opening the [Jupyter notebook](built-in-logging.ipynb), and follow the steps provided.

### üóëÔ∏è Clean up resources

When you're finished with the lab, you should remove all your deployed resources from Azure to avoid extra charges and keep your Azure subscription uncluttered.
Use the [clean-up-resources notebook](clean-up-resources.ipynb) for that.
