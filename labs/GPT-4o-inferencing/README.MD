[![flow](../../images/GPT-4o-inferencing.gif)](GPT-4o-inferencing.ipynb)

Playground to try the new GPT-4o model. GPT-4o ("o" for "omni") is designed to handle a combination of text, audio, and video inputs, and can generate outputs in text, audio, and image formats.

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.12 or later version](https://www.python.org/) installed
- [Pandas Library](https://pandas.pydata.org) installed
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed with the [Jupyter notebook extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) enabled
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed
- [An Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with Contributor permissions
- [Access granted to Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access) or just enable the mock service
- [Sign in to Azure with Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli-interactively)

### 🚀 Get started

Proceed by opening the [Jupyter notebook](GPT-4o-inferencing.ipynb), and follow the steps provided.

### 🗑️ Clean up resources

When you're finished with the lab, you should remove all your deployed resources from Azure to avoid extra charges and keep your Azure subscription uncluttered.
Use the [clean-up-resources notebook](clean-up-resources.ipynb) for that.
