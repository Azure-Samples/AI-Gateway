# APIM ‚ù§Ô∏è AI Agents

## Azure OpenAI Realtime Audio + MCP lab
![flow](../../images/realtime-audio.gif)

Playground to experiment the with [Azure OpenAI Realtime API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/realtime-audio-reference) for text and audio with integrations via [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) with Azure API Management to enable plug & play of tools to LLMs. Leverages the [credential manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/credentials-overview) for  managing OAuth 2.0 tokens to backend tools and [client token validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/validate-jwt-policy) to ensure end-to-end authentication and authorization.   
This lab includes the following MCP servers:
- Basic weather service: provide tools to get cities for a given country and retrieve random weather information for a specified city.
- Spotify service: provide tools to authenticate on Spotify using the APIM Credential Manager, retrieves Playlists, Latest releases, start/stop music playing, and more. 
- ServiceNow incidents MCP Server: provides tools to authenticates on ServiceNow using the APIM Credential Manager, lists incidents, retrieves a particular incident and create a new one.

### üöÄ Get started

Proceed by opening the [Jupyter notebook](realtime-mcp-agents.ipynb), and follow the steps provided.

### üóëÔ∏è Clean up resources

When you're finished with the lab, you should remove all your deployed resources from Azure to avoid extra charges and keep your Azure subscription uncluttered.
Use the [clean-up-resources notebook](clean-up-resources.ipynb) for that.
