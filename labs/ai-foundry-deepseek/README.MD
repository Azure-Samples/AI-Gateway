## [AI Foundry Deepseek lab](ai-foundry-deepseek.ipynb)

![flow](../../images/ai-foundry-deepseek.gif)

Playground to try the [Deepseek R1 model](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/deepseek-r1-is-now-available-on-azure-ai-foundry-and-github/) via the AI Model Inference from [Azure AI Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry). This lab uses the [Azure AI Model Inference API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/model-inference/how-to/inference?tabs=python) and two APIM LLM policies: [llm-token-limit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/llm-token-limit-policy) and [llm-emit-token-metric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/llm-emit-token-metric-policy).

### üöÄ Get started

Proceed by opening the [Jupyter notebook](ai-foundry-deepseek.ipynb), and follow the steps provided.

### üóëÔ∏è Clean up resources

When you're finished with the lab, you should remove all your deployed resources from Azure to avoid extra charges and keep your Azure subscription uncluttered.
Use the [clean-up-resources notebook](clean-up-resources.ipynb) for that.
