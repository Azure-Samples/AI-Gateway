### üöÄ Get started

Proceed by opening the [Jupyter notebook](openai-agents.ipynb), and follow the steps provided.

### üóëÔ∏è Clean up resources

When you're finished with the lab, you should remove all your deployed resources from Azure to avoid extra charges and keep your Azure subscription uncluttered.
Use the [clean-up-resources notebook](clean-up-resources.ipynb) for that.
