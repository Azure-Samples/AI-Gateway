[![flow](../../images/model-context-protocol.gif)](model-context-protocol.ipynb)

Playground to experiment the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) with Azure API Management to enable plug & play of tools to LLMs. Leverages the [credential manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/credentials-overview) for  managing OAuth 2.0 tokens to backend tools and [client token validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/validate-jwt-policy) to ensure end-to-end authentication and authorization.

### üöÄ Get started

Proceed by opening the [Jupyter notebook](model-context-protocol.ipynb), and follow the steps provided.

### üóëÔ∏è Clean up resources

When you're finished with the lab, you should remove all your deployed resources from Azure to avoid extra charges and keep your Azure subscription uncluttered.
Use the [clean-up-resources notebook](clean-up-resources.ipynb) for that.
