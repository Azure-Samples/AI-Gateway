# APIM ‚ù§Ô∏è OpenAI

## [Backend pool Load Balancing lab](backend-pool-load-balancing.ipynb)

[![flow](../../images/backend-pool-load-balancing.gif)](backend-pool-load-balancing.ipynb)

Playground to try the built-in load balancing [backend pool functionality of APIM](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/backends?tabs=bicep) to a list of Azure OpenAI endpoints.
**This is a typical prioritized PTU with fallback consumption scenario**. The lab specifically showcases how a priority 1 (highest) backend is exhausted before gracefully falling back to two equally-weighted priority 2 backends.

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.12 or later version](https://www.python.org/) installed
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed with the [Jupyter notebook extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) enabled
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed
- [An Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with Contributor permissions
- [Access granted to Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access) or just enable the mock service
- [Sign in to Azure with Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli-interactively)

### üöÄ Get started

Proceed by opening the [Jupyter notebook](backend-pool-load-balancing.ipynb), and follow the steps provided.

### üóëÔ∏è Clean up resources

When you're finished with the lab, you should remove all your deployed resources from Azure to avoid extra charges and keep your Azure subscription uncluttered.
Use the [clean-up-resources notebook](clean-up-resources.ipynb) for that.
